## Assignment Two ([Assignment Two](./Assignment-Two/))

### PART A: Data Types Recap
1. Adjust your Simple calculator app to a version that takes the year of birth of a person and
calculates their age in years, months and days respectively. Your app should give all three
outputs. ([Link to code](./Assignment-Two/age_calculator.py))

2. Create a tip calculator that takes in the total bill amount, the tip amount as a percentage of
the total bill amount (10,12 or 15 should be the options) and the number of people
splitting the bill. After getting these user input values your app should calculate the
amount each person should pay and display the answer rounded to two decimal points. ([Link to code](./Assignment-Two/tip_calculator.py))

### Part B: Control Flow
3. Create A BMI Calculator app. After calculating the BMI of a person, the calculator should
inform the person if they are underweight, Normal weight or Overweight. ([Link to code](./Assignment-Two/bmi_calculator.py))

4. Create an app that takes an year as the input and informs you whether it is a leap year or
not. ([Link to code](./Assignment-Two/leap_year.py))

## Assignment Three ([Assignment Three](./Assignment-Three/))
Remodel the simple calculator app to take an object oriented approach
